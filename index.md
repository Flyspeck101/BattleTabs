# My BattleTabs Profile 

If you don't already know, I like to play a game called [BattleTabs](https://battletabs.io), which is a fun multiplayer game based on the classic board game, Battleships. However, BattleTabs adds many features, including different ships which have abilities, revealing tiles (meaning you can target tiles to see if there is a ship there without actually hitting it), custom fleets, and, perhaps most importantly, sonar, which reveals how far away the nearest ship is. 

I have been playing BattleTabs since late May 2021, and currently, I have about 2500 points. Additionally, my winrate is around 70% (and rising), and my maximum winstreak is 57. I'm also an active community member, contributing frequently to both the [SubReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattleTabsGame/) and the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/wNkujNWkqf). In the Discord Server, there are three ranks: Community Guardian (CG), Community Hero (CH), and Community Moderator (Mod). I am currently a Community Hero, and I'm also 6th on the MEE6 leaderboard. 

Additionally, I have created a number of guides and surveys for the community, and I'm always responsive to DMs. However, I will not accept BattleTabs friend requests from people who I do not have any other link with (IRL or through Discord or Reddit). But if you send me a friend request on Discord (Flyspeck101#3903) I'll be sure to respond. I'm also a beta tester for BattleTabs, and I sometimes stream battles in the Discord server. I also enjoy completing [challenges](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattleTabsGame/comments/q8eheu/list_of_battletabs_challenges/) sometimes. 

I consider myself to be a good player, amongst the ranks of players like [XVOZI05378](https://battletabs.io/player/cfaffac1-131d-415d-b2e7-d26760a43148), [Chiaki Nanami](https://battletabs.io/player/c91abe58-8a87-4310-88d9-eb2b8c8047b8) and [Destructor](https://battletabs.io/player/d3339406-5886-48cf-9ba0-012116b0df65).
